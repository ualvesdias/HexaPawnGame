# HexaPawnGame
A Python implementation of the game Hexapawn, described in the "Mathematical Games" section of the American Scientific magazine, March, 1962.

As described by Gardner, the goal of the game is to show how to build a machine that can learn from its mistakes, as well as with its victories, because it is "punished" or "rewarded" if it loses or wins a round, respectively.

As you play the machine, you can see that at first, it's really bad playing. But as the rounds go by, it starts to learn which moves are bad, discarting them, and which are good, keeping it as the only possible move for the current board configuration.
